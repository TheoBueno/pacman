#  Title of the project: Pacmen

## Description of the project:

  This project involves a Factory for making Pacmen who will move around the 
page, there's array of pacmen, which keeps track of the position and velocity 
of each pacman.
 
## How to Use:
  When the "make one" button is pressed the pacmen will appear, they will 
move around the page and bounce off any wall on contact.

## Roadmap of future improvements: 
  I would possibly change this project by creating little fruits on screen 
that disapear, maybe with a 'pop' sound or visual effect once the a pacmen 
overlaps with them.
